> I really enjoyed Landmark and gained a lot out of the first course. It really was incredibly insightful. With that said, Landmark is a business. They don't make any bones about telling you this. I didn't do the advanced course because I felt like I had gained what I wanted from the first course. I may do the second course some day. My mom did the first and second course (regular and advanced) and really loved them, but didn't enjoy the third course (whatever comes after the advanced class, I forget the name) because she wasn't really interested in the goals of the course.

> When I finished my first Landmark course, I recommended it to a lot of people. It had varying results for them. Most found it to be positive. The least successful person with Landmark (and this person wouldn't say it about themselves, but I regret recommending it to them) was looking more for therapy and verification of their perspective and interpreted everything through that. I personally think it was not beneficial for them, but then again, I'm not this person and I don't really blame Landmark for this one though. This person is stuck in this particular rut, and Landmark wasn't enough to kick them out of it, unfortunately.

> I personally think it's (highly) beneficial depending on where you are in your life and your general outlook. It was extremely helpful for a lot of people who had experienced trauma, but they wanted to move through/past it. If you don't, for whatever reason, I don't think Landmark will help. I don't think Landmark will hurt (even my friend basically just came out the same -- no better or worse -- and she enjoyed the seminars.)

> As for me, while I have my own drama, I didn't have any major trauma to overcome. Also, I'm the type of person who is into self improvement and have been most of my life. For example, I'm a huge fan of motivational literature, audio, and etc. Earl Nightingale's "The Strangest Secret" has guided many aspects of my life since I was a teenager. I have also been through a number (too many) business opportunities, some better than others. I've been snowed before and I know what it looks like. Landmark isn't a scam. At the same time, it's not a charity either. They are exceedingly upfront about this, and they will work to get you more deeply involved in their organization. That wasn't for me, but I don't consider it a negative either because the people I've met who have taken more leadership roles and courses in Landmark have benefited from it and have basically been happy about it.

> With this experience, my advice if you are considering Landmark is:
> 
> 1. It's not going to fix you or any of your problems. If you go into it thinking you're going to be fixed in some way, you won't.
> 2. It will give you a new way of approaching and thinking about life that will positively change how you communicate with others and how you approach setbacks and problems. The main benefit for me with Landmark was being shown how to recognize how much we allow our own histories, societal expectations, and our habits to shape our behavior without our own creative input. We often fall into habitual roles with the people around us and follow those scripts without thinking about them, thus making us victims of those habits, not because they are good or bad (which is irrelevant) but because they are not analyzed/thought about -- even when we know they don't work.
> 3. Integrity is the cornerstone of their model. They are very serious about it and this means that they are very clear about what they are selling you and the value of it. If you don't want what they are selling, you can leave and people do.
> 4. The approach of Landmark is a lot of Socratic method, but it does have a goal and whether or not you agree with it, you do get there and for me, at least, it was incredibly valuable. I hate being so vague, but it's difficult to explain unless you've been through it.
> 5. Does this make it a cult? No idea. I do know that I went to the forum, got what I wanted out of it and left when I wanted to, having spent the amount of money I wanted to.
> 6. The whole thing with the EST (from the 70's) locking you in a room and not letting you use the bathroom, etc, is not true. Or at least it wasn't for me in 2014 when I did the course.
> 7. There is a lot of social pressure in Landmark to follow the coursework. It's no more than with any other motivational/self improvement track of the type though, and considerably less than a number of business opportunities I've done. Also much less than you'll get out of a sorority or fraternity.
> 
> To wrap up, I found Landmark to be extremely valuable and I use the skills I gained from the coursework (their transformation) to this day. At the same time, it's not for everyone. Read up on the program and then decide for yourself. The actual coursework actually makes it much easier for a person to resist social pressure, imo.
