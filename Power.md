description: Power is word realized.

Power is word realized. Power is the capacity to have your word manifest in reality *without using force*.

For example, I say "I want an ice cream" and you get an ice cream. Greater power allows either in greater velocity or greater scope of realization.

### Power vs Force

Power is distinct from [[Force]]. With power there is no pulling, pushing, compelling, threatening. No right and wrong.

If you have power you don't need to dominate, manipulate, cajole or threaten.
