### History of the est Training

**1971**

- In June [Werner Erhard](http://www.wernererhard.net/cv.html) had a realization about the nature of being…
- And in October that realization manifested into the est Training. Werner Erhard first led the est Training in San Francisco at the Jack Tar Hotel and the world of possibility was born.
- Laurel Sheaf named as president and CEO of est
- First est office, 2nd floor on Kearney Street in San Francisco
- Original est staff members included [Werner Erhard](http://www.wernererhard.net/), [Gonneke Spits](http://www.google.com/profiles/gonneke.gonneke.spits), [Laurel Scheaf](http://www.facebook.com/people/Laurel-Scheaf/100000604196380), Jack Rafferty and Elaine Cronin
- While only about 600 people participated in est Training by the end of 1971, it was the beginning of something new. The beginning of people getting that what is, is and what isn’t, isn’t and you can choose to be responsible for your life. People took on making a difference in their lives, their community and the world.

- “You Are The Gift”. Inside of making a difference a group of est graduates formed the Holiday Project. A not-for-profit organization that gave people, who participated in the project, the experience of contributing to others with both time and simple gifts.

By virtue of the communication and projects initiated by the half a million people who completed the est Training, the possibility that transformation has become a part of the fabric of the culture; its value is self-evident, its validity assured. In January 1985 Werner introduced the Forum, a program he developed in part through his education and ideas in traditional philosophy.
