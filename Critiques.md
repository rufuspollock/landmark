> Today we welcome Alan Cahn who has over 40 years of experience in personal development, 30 of them with Landmark Worldwide. Alan talks about his journey before he does the est training in 1976, including his experiences with Zen Buddhism and mystical Christian groups and how he makes his way, first onto W.E.A Staff (1985), and then becoming a Landmark Forum leader (1988). Alan tells us his unique story and touches on the experiential nature of the est training and the role of Werner Erhard as a leader. Alan discusses some of his personal and professional challenges as he grapples with the abusive culture of the times and Landmarks staff culture. He shares his motivations for staying for the “mission” even when he didn’t agree with the “means”. This episode brings us right up to Alan’s leaving Landmark. In Part TWO coming later this week Alan gets into the why his leaving and his post Landmark experience. Subscribe to be notified when we post nee content.

Especially interesting as Alan was a Forum Leader etc. Plus a lot about his journey in general.
