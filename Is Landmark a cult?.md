No.

A cult has things like:

- A charismatic leader. **Landmark does not have this. It has a decentralized leadership team.**
- Religion or creed you must blindly believe in. **Landmark is non-religious and explicitly encourages people to look for themselves.**
- Encourage members to donate money. **Landmark explicitly does not allow donations or gifts**

So why do people use this term sometimes?

The main reason is that some people get very passionate about Landmark (and Landmark encourages people who got something from the Forum to actively "share").

This can create a proselytising or evangelical energy around Landmark that can put some people off.
